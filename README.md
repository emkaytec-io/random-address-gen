# Random Address Generator

AWS Lambda function created in Node.js with Faker and USPS Web Tools to generate a random address with a fake street address, and valid city-state-zip combination.

## Note about `states.json`

This is a static file that was created if I ever wanted to do some geocoding work.  Decided to go the zip code route, but leaving this file in here so I don't have to regenerate.
